                <h2 id="splash">Profile Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    
                 The structure of the page is organized using &lt;section&gt; elements, which divide the content into meaningful segments, such as profile information, volunteering, interests, and contact sections. This approach improves readability and accessibility.
                 One notable styling feature is the use of inline CSS within certain elements, such as <code>style="background-image: url(images/background2.avif);"</code>, which adds background images to sections, enhancing the visual appeal. <P> Inline styles are used selectively while most of the styling is handled through an external CSS file (profile.css).
                 Images play a crucial role in the design, with &lt;img&gt; tags used to display profile pictures and other relevant visuals. The inclusion of the alt attribute ensures accessibility by providing descriptions for screen readers.</p> <P>
                 The skills section features a visual representation of proficiency levels using &lt;span class="bar" style="width: 90%;"&gt;90%&lt;/span&gt;. This approach visually indicates the user’s skills, making it easier for viewers to assess qualifications.,</P>
                 <p>To enhance interactivity, JavaScript is used within dropdown elements for selecting dates dynamically. The script within &lt;script&gt; tags generates numbers for days and years, reducing manual input and making the form more user-friendly.
                 A &lt;table&gt; is used in the availability section to neatly present schedule details. Tables help in organizing structured data effectively and improving readability.</p><P>
                 The contact form includes &lt;input&gt; fields with attributes like <code>type="email" required</code>, ensuring that users enter valid data before submission. This simple validation improves the user experience by preventing errors.
                 Finally, the footer contains a &lt;footer&gt; tag, which includes a link to an editor page using &lt;a href="editor-page.html"&gt;Student 4&lt;/a&gt;. This provides a professional touch and credits the designer.
                 Overall, the use of structured HTML elements, responsive design techniques, JavaScript functionality, and accessibility features results in a well-structured and engaging webpage. These coding choices contribute to the page’s usability, readability, and effectiveness in delivering its intended message.

                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Sitemap page encourages is a structured list of a website's pages, helping users and search engines navigate and understand its content efficiently.
                  
                </p>
                <p>&lt;section&gt; is used to group related content, improving organization and accessibility.

                    &lt;svg&gt; is implemented for a visual sitemap, with &lt;rect&gt; elements representing buttons and &lt;line&gt; elements creating connections between sections.
                    
                    &lt;g class="button"&gt; groups interactive elements, enabling hover effects through CSS transitions for enhanced user experience.
                    
                    An external CSS file (sitemap.css) is linked to maintain consistent styling, and Google Fonts are used for typography enhancement.
                    
                    The &lt;footer&gt; provides credits and navigation links, ensuring clarity and professionalism in the layout.

            <!-- Content Page -->
            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The content page provides an overview of physical health and wellness. Key features include:
                </p>
                <p>The page structure is organized using &lt;section&gt; elements, which divide the content into distinct segments like "What is Social Health?", "Factors That Influence Social Health", and more. This segmentation enhances readability and organization.</p>

                <p>A notable syntax feature is the use of <code>style="background-image: url(images/background2.avif);"</code> in the &lt;body&gt; tag to apply a background image to the entire page, enhancing the visual appeal. Inline CSS is used selectively, but most of the styling is handled externally in the content.css file, keeping the HTML file clean and manageable.</p>
                
                <p>Images play a significant role in the design, with &lt;img&gt; tags used to display visuals such as pictures related to social health. The class="pics" and class="pics1" attributes are used to style these images, including hover effects such as <code>transform: scale(1.1)</code> and <code>opacity: 0.8</code>, providing an interactive user experience. These visual effects enhance the page's dynamic feel.</p>
                
                <p>For the text content, headings are organized using &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; tags, which improve the content structure and accessibility. The page includes &lt;nav&gt; elements with &lt;a&gt; tags, providing a fixed navigation bar on the right side of the page that allows easy access to different sections using anchor links. These anchors help users navigate through the page without needing to scroll.</p>
                
                <p>Interactive elements, such as the "Go to Top" button, are implemented with the &lt;a&gt; tag and <code>href="#top"</code> link, allowing users to quickly jump back to the top of the page. This is complemented by the <code>position: fixed</code> CSS property, which keeps the button in a consistent position even as users scroll.</p>
                
                <p>The &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags are used to create lists in sections such as "Why is Social Health Important?" and "Factors That Influence Social Health." These lists are enhanced with customized styles for the list items (e.g., <code>font-size: 18px;</code>) to make them more readable and visually appealing.</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, the use of &lt;section&gt; tags for each distinct content block (e.g., class="sect1", class="sect2") allows for easy sectioning of the content, making the page more user-friendly and accessible. The &lt;footer&gt; element is included at the bottom of the page, providing a professional touch to the design.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, the combination of structured HTML elements, external and inline CSS, and interactive features significantly enhances the page’s usability, readability, and aesthetic appeal. These syntaxes work together to deliver a well-organized, visually engaging, and user-friendly experience.</p>
